## Understanding the V60:

The V60, named for its V-shaped cone with a 60-degree angle, is designed for precision, allowing water to flow toward the center, extending the contact time. It features a single large hole at the bottom, with spiral ridges along the walls to aid in air flow during brewing, promoting a more even extraction.

What You'll Need:

- V60 dripper
- V60 filters
- Freshly ground coffee (medium-fine grind)
- Kettle (preferably a gooseneck kettle for controlled pouring)
- Scale
- Timer
- Mug or carafe

## Brewing Steps:

1. Prepare Your Coffee:
   Start by heating your water to around 200°F (93°C). While your water is heating, place a filter in the V60 dripper and rinse it with hot water to eliminate any paper taste and to preheat the brewer. Discard the rinse water from your mug or carafe.

2. Measure and Grind:
   For a standard 12 oz cup, use about 24 grams of coffee. A medium-fine grind is ideal for the V60. The grind size should resemble table salt – not as fine as an espresso grind but finer than what you would use for a drip machine.

3. Bloom Your Coffee:
   Place the V60 and carafe (or mug) on your scale, add the coffee grounds, and zero out the scale. Start your timer as you gently pour just enough water to saturate the grounds (about twice the amount of coffee in grams, so around 50 grams of water). This step, called the bloom, allows the coffee to degas, enabling a better extraction.

4. Pour and Brew:
   After 30 seconds of blooming, begin pouring the remaining water in slow, concentric circles, keeping the water level steady just above the coffee grounds. The pour should be slow and controlled, taking about 2-3 minutes to complete. Aim for a total brew time (including the bloom) of about 3.5 minutes.

5. Enjoy Your Coffee:
   Once the dripping slows to an occasional drop, remove the V60 and savor the fruits of your labor. A well-brewed V60 coffee should be clear, flavorful, and free of any bitterness or sediment.

## Tips for Perfection:

- Consistency is key. Practice your pouring technique to ensure a steady and even flow of water.
- Experiment with different grind sizes and pouring rates to find what tastes best for your preferred coffee bean.
  -Always use fresh, filtered water and high-quality, freshly roasted coffee.

The V60 pour over is more than just a brewing method; it's a ritual that offers a moment of reflection and appreciation for the complexities of coffee. It rewards patience and precision, making that first sip all the more delightful. Whether you're a seasoned barista or a curious newcomer, the V60 is a tool that can elevate your coffee experience, one cup at a time. Happy brewing!
